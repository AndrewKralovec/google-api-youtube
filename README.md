# google-api-youtube
Implementation of an python3 program i made to upload files to youtube

## About 
My friends and I have a side project, that uses an IRC server. Given a certain condition, the irc server needs to tell our main django server to upload a video to youtube. So, i created main.py which will upload videos to my youtube account (We'll circle back to this fact later). This project is to host that file. This project will be updated to show usage later on. 

## Usage 
Todo
Need to tell them how to generate the oauth, and how the youtube api has no service accounts. Shame on you google. Just kidding, i understand the development life, and do not blame google for this lack of a feature (not to mention the invention of go lang gets them a huge get out of jail free card in my book).
